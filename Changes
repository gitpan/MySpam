    MySpam
        Force things to 'croak' under test instead of just sending messages to
        the syslog. This should produce more informative reports from the CPAN
        testers.

    Makefile.PL, debian/control
        Upgrade dependency on SQL::DB 0.08 and libsql-db-perl 0.08-1.
    
    MySpam
        Migrated to the new api of SQL::DB v0.08. This allowed us to get rid of
        the hack for setting the MySQL engine type. Should also be a
        performance improvement during quarantine since we can now get the list
        of recipient IDs in one call.
    
        (Re)moved the raw() method into release() as it relied on the old
        SQL::DB::fetcho() call and was anyway only used internally.

        Default location of whitelist.dbm is now /var/lib/myspam/whitelist.dbm.
    
    conf/transport
        Removed max_output option which seems to break exim in etch.
    
    debian/myspam.postinst
        * Automatically create the database tables on install if dbi points to
        /var/lib/myspam/myspam.db and that file is empty.
        * More dpkg-statoverride's for directories and files.

    General
        Almost completed documentation for everything.
    
    Makefile.PL
        Added /var/lib/myspam and /var/lib/myspam/myspam.db to the install.
        The myspam.db file is zero length, but at least for Debian installs the
        file will already be owned by Debian-exim.
    
    bin/myspam-smtp
        Make 'subscribe' the same as 'subscribe1' (Thanks to Robert Meyer for
        the suggestion).
    
    conf/myspam.conf
        Default dbi string is now dbi:SQLite:/var/lib/myspam/myspam.db. This
        means that in the simplest case the administrator can simply run
        'myspam install --db' and update-exim4.conf / reload and things will
        just work.
    
    debian/conffiles
        Added missing /etc/spamassassin/whitelistdbm.cf
    
    debian/myspam.cron.d
        Now complete with 'expire', 'newsletter' and comments.

    Fixes from Robert Meyer <r.meyer@net-wizard.org>:
    
        bin/myspam
            Now takes case-independent command options
    
        bin/myspam-smtp
            * Now takes case-independent Subject: commands
            * Regex fixes for identifying commands
    
        lib/MySpam.pm
            * Insert only unique recipients for each mail
            * InnoDB definition for MySQL now works
            * Make whitelist.dbm file world readable after generation.

    General:
        Updated to use and depend on SQL::DB v0.06.
    
    bin/myspam:
        New "expire" option, instead of automatically expiring after every
        quarantine. It doesn't make sense that some command-line user has to
        wait for that maintenance.
    
        cm() method is now cached so can be called multiple times without
        starting new connections. Moved cm() out of quarantine() into
        quarantine_file().
    
        Bugfix: quarantine_file() was calling MySpam->quarantine() instead
        of MySpam->quarantine_file().
        (Thanks to Robert Meyer <r.meyer@net-wizard.org>).
