    General
        New email 'help' command to list the usage.
    
    Makefile.PL
        Perl package name has changed from 'myspam' to 'MySpam'.
    
    debian/control
        Depends on libsql-db-perl >= 0.06-3.
    
    debian/myspam.postinst
        Statoverrides on directories/files is now 'Debian-exim.adm'. Can add
        yourself to the 'adm' group and run all the commands without having to
        'sudo'.
    
        Fixed the automatic DB installation to actually work now.

    debian/myspam.postinst
        * Automatically create the database tables on install if dbi points to
        /var/lib/myspam/myspam.db and that file is empty.

    General
        Almost completed documentation for everything.
    
    Makefile.PL
        Added /var/lib/myspam and /var/lib/myspam/myspam.db to the install.
        The myspam.db file is zero length, but at least for Debian installs the
        file will already be owned by Debian-exim.
    
    bin/myspam-smtp
        Make 'subscribe' the same as 'subscribe1' (Thanks to Robert Meyer for
        the suggestion).
    
    conf/myspam.conf
        Default dbi string is now dbi:SQLite:/var/lib/myspam/myspam.db. This
        means that in the simplest case the administrator can simply run
        'myspam install --db' and update-exim4.conf / reload and things will
        just work.
    
    debian/conffiles
        Added missing /etc/spamassassin/whitelistdbm.cf
    
    debian/myspam.cron.d
        Now complete with 'expire', 'newsletter' and comments.

    Fixes from Robert Meyer <r.meyer@net-wizard.org>:
    
        bin/myspam
            Now takes case-independent command options
    
        bin/myspam-smtp
            * Now takes case-independent Subject: commands
            * Regex fixes for identifying commands
    
        lib/MySpam.pm
            * Insert only unique recipients for each mail
            * InnoDB definition for MySQL now works
            * Make whitelist.dbm file world readable after generation.

    General:
        Updated to use and depend on SQL::DB v0.06.
    
    bin/myspam:
        New "expire" option, instead of automatically expiring after every
        quarantine. It doesn't make sense that some command-line user has to
        wait for that maintenance.
    
        cm() method is now cached so can be called multiple times without
        starting new connections. Moved cm() out of quarantine() into
        quarantine_file().
    
        Bugfix: quarantine_file() was calling MySpam->quarantine() instead
        of MySpam->quarantine_file().
        (Thanks to Robert Meyer <r.meyer@net-wizard.org>).
