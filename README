MySpam
=======

MySpam is a tool for managing mail that has been quarantined
by sa-exim. It works like this.

1. Every five minutes cron(8) calls "myspam quarantine" on the
/var/spool/sa-exim/SApermreject/new directory. This inserts the
mails in that directory into a database. The mail files are then
removed.

2. Users can send a mail to myspam@your.domain with various commands
in the Subject header. The commands allow them to list their quarantined
mails, to release mails, to add addresses to a whitelist, or to subscribe
to a (bi-)weekly mail of their quarantine list.

3. Every half hour cron(8) calls "myspam whitelist" to generate a DBM
file which an included SpamAssassin plugin can use to decrease the scores
of particular sender/recipient combinations at sa-exim time.

4. Every evening cron(8) calls "myspam expire" to remove mails from the
database that are older than one month.

5. Once a week cron(8) calls "myspam newsletter" to send out to all
subscribers users the list of their recently quarantined mails.

Almost all options are controllable either through the
/etc/myspam/myspam.conf configuration file, or by modifying the cron
entries. Even the CSS for the html part of email responses can be
customized.


DEBIAN INSTALLATION

Add the following to your /etc/apt/sources.list:

    deb http://rekudos.net/ stable main

and then do an "apt-get update; apt-get install myspam".


OTHER INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test        # optional - will send mails to postmaster
   make install


The "make install" command puts files in /etc/exim4/conf.d/ so you will also
want to run update-exim4.conf or update-exim4.conf.template to pick up
those changes, or manually integrate those files into your configuration.
Copy the debian/myspam.cron.d file to somewhere in your cron(8)
configuration directory. You will also probably have to restart
SpamAssassin to pick up the WhitelistDBM.pm plugin.

For the quarantining process to work the SAmaxrcptlistlength configuration
item in /etc/exim4/sa-exim.conf must be set to a value greater than 0.
This makes sa-exim add the X-SA-Exim-Rcpt-To header which we need in order
to know to whom the mail was to have been delivered.


The myspam(1) manpage is probably a good place to start once you have
this package installed.
