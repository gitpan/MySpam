myspam
========

myspam is a tool for managing mail that has been quarantined
by sa-exim. It stores the quarantined mails in a database and
has both a command-line and an email interface.

For the quarantining process to work the SAmaxrcptlistlength configuration
item in /etc/exim4/sa-exim.conf must be set to a value greater than 0.
This makes sa-exim add the X-SA-Exim-Rcpt-To header which we need.

This package also contains a Whitelist module for SpamAssassin, and the
users can set their whitelist through the email interface.

The myspam(1) manpage is probably a good place to start once you have
this package installed.


DEBIAN INSTALLATION

Add the following to your /etc/apt/sources.list:

    deb http://rekudos.net/ stable main

and then do an "apt-get update; apt-get install myspam".


OTHER INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test        # optional - will send mails to postmaster
   make install


The "make install" command puts files in /etc/exim4/conf.d/ so you will also
want to run update-exim4.conf or update-exim4.conf.template to pick up
those changes.

You will probably want to copy the debian/myspam.cron.d file to somewhere
in your cron(8) configuration directory.
